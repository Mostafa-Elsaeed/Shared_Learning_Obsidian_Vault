## Single Responsibility Principles (S.R.P)
This principle states that every method/class should handle a single responsibility. This is important because it results in better readability of code and separation of concerns.
```typescript title:single-responsability.ts

const fetchPosts = async (userId: number) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}/posts`
    );
    return await response.json();
  } catch (e) {
    handleError(e, "Error while fetching Posts!");
  }
};
```
---
## Open / Closed

The core meaning of the Open/Closed principle is made clear by the statement: 
*open to extension, closed for modification.*
The idea is that a class, once implemented, should be closed for any further modification. If any more functionality is needed, it can be added later using extension features such asÂ **inheritance**. This is primarily done to avoid breaking existing code and unit tests. It also results in a modular code.

## Liskov Substitution 
if C is a subtype of P, then objects of type P may be replaced with objects of type C without altering any of the desirable properties of the program
```typescript title:liskov-violation.ts
class Employee {

readonly name: string;

protected hoursWorked: number;

  

constructor(name: string, hoursWorked: number) {

this.name = name;

this.hoursWorked = hoursWorked;

}

  

calculateSalary(): number {

return this.hoursWorked * 10;

}

}

  

class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {

// Override the parent implementation

override calculateSalary(): number {

// maybe full-time employees get a fixed bonus

return this.hoursWorked * 15 + 500;

}

}

  

class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee{

override calculateSalary():number{

return this.hoursWorked *8;

}

}
```

## Interface Segregation

```typescript title:interface-segregation-violation.ts

interface TaskManger{

createTask(taskName:string):void;

assignTask(taskName:string,assigne:string):void;

sendNotification(message:string,recipient:string):void;

}

  

class TaskService implements TaskManger{

createTask(taskName:string){

console.log(taskName);

}

  

assignTask(taskName:string,assigne:string){

console.log(taskName,assigne);

}

  

sendNotification(message:string,recipient:string){

console.log(message,recipient);

}

}
```

```typescript title:interface-segregation.ts
interface TaskManger{

createTask(taskName:string):void;

assignTask(taskName:string,assigne:string):void;

}

interface NotificationManger{

sendNotification(message:string,recipient:string):void;

}

  

class TaskService implements TaskManger{

createTask(taskName:string){

console.log(taskName);

}

  

assignTask(taskName:string,assigne:string){

console.log(taskName,assigne);

}

}
```
